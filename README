To run Supremica you need a Java 2 compliant JVM.
All development is done with Sun's JDK 1.3. For best
performance you should use IBM JDK 1.3. You also need to
Ant - the Java build system. Secure shell (SSH) are needed
dor communicating with Signals and Systems computers.

A short tutorial of how to compile and run
Supremica is following.

1. Checkout
	Enter a directory where you want to store
	the Supremica files, e.g. "/home/ka/projects". The checkout the
	sources, write:
	
	If you are at one of S2's Unix computers:
	> cvs checkout Supremica
	
	If you are at an external computer:
	> export CVS_RSH=ssh  (for bash)
	> setenv CVS_RSH ssh  (for tcsh)
	> cvs -d ka@linus.s2.chalmers.se:/users/s2/cvs checkout Supremica

2. Compiling
	The first time you compile after a checkout you should write:
	> ant initialize
	
	You should also run the previous command as soon
	as a there is a new or updated file in Supremica/lib.

	For compiling the sources there are three main
	alternatives.
	
	i. Compile all files changed since last compilation
	> ant compile
	
	ii. Compile all files changed since last compilation and
	build a jar file.
	> ant build
	
	iii. Compile all files and build a jar file.
	> ant rebuild
	First all existing class files are deleted, then
	a compilation of all java files are done.
	
	Alternative iii, is the preferred alternative, and is
	also the one executed if you run ant without arguments.
	Note that alternative i, can be fast if you only want
	to check that some change you done is going though the
	compiler.
	
3. Run
	Two alternatives:
	
	i. Enter Supremica/dist, write:
	> Supremica    (for Windows)
	> ./Supremica  (for Unix)
		
	ii. Run Supremica through Ant. Enter Supremica and write
	> ant run
	
	For Windows: If you have everything set up correctly you should also
	be able to double-click on Supremica/dist/Supremica.jar
	in the Explorer.

4. Update
	Enter the Supremica directory, write:
	> cvs update -d

5. Commit changes
 	Enter the Supremica directory, write:
	> cvs commit

6. Add a new file into cvs
	Enter the directory where the file resides, write:
	cvs add filename.java
