You need a git client to checkout the sources. Please check
the help system in github.com account for more information.

To compile and run Supremica you need Java 1.8 or higher
and ANT.

From 2005-02-17 Waters is included. Waters includes the graphical
editor and simulator for automata. Waters is developed by Robi Malik,
at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.  Robi can be reached at
robi@waikato.ac.nz.

To report problems or ask questions, send email to knut@supremica.org

If you run benchmark problems in Supremica, please give me a chance to 
comment the results before publishing.


A short tutorial on how to compile and run Supremica is following. 

1. Checkout
    Enter a directory where you want to store the Supremica files,
    e.g. "/home/ka/projects". To checkout the sources, write:

    > git clone git@github.com:Chalmers-Control-Automation-Mechatronics/Supremica.git

    If you have got a C++ compiler and want to compile the C++ sources of
    the Waters libraries, you need to configure it first. Enter the
    subdirectory waters/ inside the project directory, and copy the file
    build.properties.sample under the name of build.properties. Then edit
    the new file build.properties as per instructions in the file. These
    steps are optional as it is not necessary to compile C++:

2. Compiling and running from command line

    To compile Supremica, you need to have Ant installed
    The first time you compile after a checkout you should write:
    > ant initialize

    This command should be used again if you fetch a new working copy
    that contains major changes, or if you edit non-Java files.

    For compiling the sources there are two main alternatives.

    i. Compile all files changed since last compilation
    > ant compile

    ii. Compile all files and build a jar file.
    > ant rebuild

    Alternative ii is the preferred alternative, and it is
    also the one executed if you run ant without arguments.
    Note that alternative i can be fast if you only want
    to check that some change you done is going though the
    compiler.

    To run Supremica, enter Supremica/dist, and write:
    > IDE          (for Windows)
    > ./IDE        (for Linux)

3. Using an IDE

    Most development is done using an IDE. Netbeans and Eclipse 
    are supported. Please see the Supremica Wiki at github.com
    for more details on checking out and compiling using these
    systems.
