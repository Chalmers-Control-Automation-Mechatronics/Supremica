The sag stuff is preferably developed within eclipse (http:\\eclipse.org)

* Install eclipse
* install GMF and all other stuff that GMF requires (EMF, GEF, OCL etc)
* In eclipse, do File->Import and select "General->import existing projects into workspace"
   * Choose <yourpath>\Supremica\sag as root directory and select all projects that appear
   * Do NOT copy into workspace
