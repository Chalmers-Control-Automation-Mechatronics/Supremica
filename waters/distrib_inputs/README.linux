Welcome to Waters/Supremica IDE

To run the software, you need to have a Java 1.8 runtime environment
or higher.  Please make sure the java executable is in your search
path, or the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to your Java
installation, or edit the script waters so it can find a working java
executable.

This version of Waters/Supremica IDE includes precompiled binaries
for NNN-bit Linux. You will need a NNN-bit Java Virtual Machine
(not necessarily NNN-bit Linux) to run this.

For complete functionality of the analyser, you also need to
install GraphViz 2.26, available from
  http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable
Just make sure the dot executable is in your search path.
Higher versions than 2.26 unfortunately do not work.

To run the IDE, please execute the script waters in this directory.
You may add the directory to your search path or create an alias
or link to run the script from elsewhere.

Have fun!
