There is currently no real bug-tracking system for Supremica/Waters... we should start a new one! 

 * In the IDE, if a file is opened, then changed outside the IDE and then opened again in IDE, the change can not be seen! The DocumentManager caches too much?
   * DocumentManager can be upgraded to check file modification times. But how should the IDE react if the contents of a module being edited are changed by an external program? -- Robi.
     * Ideally it should inform the user about "external modification" - like buffers in emacs. /Hugo
 * Problem in the IDE when using special characters in state names (åäö för example). Saved files can not be opened.
   * Special characters should not be permitted to enter -- Robi.
 * ProjectBuildFromWaters must use DocumentManager from IDE, otherwise module instantiation does not work -- Robi.
 * Supremica Synthesis fails on tictactoe example (no initial state reported) -- Robi.
 * New modules should not contain any events. Default markings :accepting and :forbidden should only be created when explicitly requested -- Robi.
 * Currently some examples exist in double "copies", in examples/waters/handwritten and in  examples/includeInJarFile/ModuleExamples... 

 * Check menu keyboard shortcuts. ALT or CONTROL --- presently ALT-E
   is used twice -- Robi.
 * Group node error feedback should be given while dragging -- Robi.
 * Flip edge operation is broken -- Robi.
 * Encapsulated Postscript exporter is broken. It is trying to reimplement
   renderer functionality which, predictably, does not work properly.
   Printing _must_ be done through Renderer and Graphics2D somehow -- Robi.
 * Selection should not be shown when printing -- Robi.
 * Log display is very slow when large numbers of messages are logged -- Robi.

 * TestAutomatonMinimizer does not terminate: Conflict equivalence
   minimization fails on automaton F in ConflictEquivalenceExamples -- Robi.
 * DNFMinimizer fails several test cases -- Robi.

Previously, all bugs were reported and stored in the bug database, http://www.supremica.org/bugtracking, but this is no longer the case.
