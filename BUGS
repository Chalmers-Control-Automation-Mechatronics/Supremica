distThere is currently no real bug-tracking system for Supremica/Waters... we should start a new one! 

 * In the IDE, if a file is opened, then changed outside the IDE and then opened again in IDE, the change can not be seen! The DocumentManager caches too much?
   DocumentManager can be upgraded to check file modification times. But how should the IDE react if the contents of a module being edited are changed by an external program? -- Robi.
 * The IDE prints using the wrong bounding box, large automata become cropped. It works as it should in Waters!
 * Problem in the IDE when using non-UTF-8 characters in state names (��� f�r example). Saved files can not be opened.
   Special characters should not be permitted to enter -- Robi.
 * ProjectBuildFromWaters must use DocumentManager from IDE, otherwise module instantiation does not work -- Robi.
 * Supremica Synthesis fails on tictactoe example (no initial state reported) -- Robi.
 * New modules should not contain any events. Default markings :accepting and :forbidden should only be created when explicitly requested -- Robi.

 * Change menu keyboard shortcuts to ALT
 * Grid does not show properly
 * Right click breaks label dragging
 * Group node error feedback should be given while dragging

Previously, all bugs were reported and stored in the bug database, http://www.supremica.org/bugtracking, but this is no longer the case.
