There is currently no real bug-tracking system for Supremica/Waters... we should start a new one! 

 * Problem in Waters when using non-UTF-8 characters in state names (едц fцr example). Saved files can not be opened.
 * Monolithic Synthesis does not remove non-reachable states which it should (why not?).

Previously, all bugs were reported and stored in the bug database, http://www.supremica.org/bugtracking, but this is no longer the case.
