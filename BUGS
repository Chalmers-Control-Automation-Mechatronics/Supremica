Known bugs...

* Multiple executors won't work properly... especially with the
ExhaustiveSearch-option. The executor that finds the uncontrollable state
doesn't stop the other executors!

* The extra state for complement automata has a fix name. If an automaton
already has a state with that name, bad things happen.

* AutomataExplorer does not show correct set of incoming events.

* Setting the AutomatonType does not work with Java 1.4 beta 3 but it works with Java 1.3.1.
