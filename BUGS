There is currently no real bug-tracking system for Supremica/Waters... we should start a new one! 

 * In the IDE, if a file is opened, then changed outside the IDE and then opened again in IDE, the change can not be seen! The DocumentManager caches too much?
 * The IDE prints using the wrong bounding box, large automata become cropped. It works as it should in Waters!
 * Problem in the IDE when using non-UTF-8 characters in state names (åäö för example). Saved files can not be opened.
 * Monolithic Synthesis does not remove non-reachable states which it should (why not?).

 * New modules should not contain any events. Default markings :accepting and :forbidden should only be created when explicitly requested.

Previously, all bugs were reported and stored in the bug database, http://www.supremica.org/bugtracking, but this is no longer the case.
