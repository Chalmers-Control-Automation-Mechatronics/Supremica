Known bugs...

* Multiple executors won't work properly... especially with the
ExhaustiveSearch-option. The executor that finds the uncontrollable state
doesn't stop the other executors!

* The extra state for complement automata has a fix name. If an automaton
already has a state with that name, bad things happen.

* Synthesis also returns a fix name... almost... it could get wrong sometimes, anyway. // Fixed 2001-11-12 by ka
