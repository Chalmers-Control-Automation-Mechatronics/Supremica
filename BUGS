BUGS are now handled in a bug-tracking system. Find and 
access it through
             www.supremica.org/admin

If you want to simply view the bugs, click the "View" tab                    
and then "Bugs", if you want to edit the bugs, click the                       
"Pages" tab and then "bugs" in the list.

 * In the IDE, if a file is opened, then changed outside the IDE and then opened again in IDE, the change can not be seen! The DocumentManager caches too much?
   * DocumentManager can be upgraded to check file modification times. But how should the IDE react if the contents of a module being edited are changed by an external program? -- Robi.
     * Ideally it should inform the user about "external modification" - like buffers in emacs. /Hugo
 * Problem in the IDE when using special characters in state names (åäö för example). Saved files can not be opened.
   * Special characters should not be permitted to enter -- Robi.
 * ProjectBuildFromWaters must use DocumentManager from IDE, otherwise module instantiation does not work -- Robi.
 * New modules should not contain any events. Default markings :accepting and :forbidden should only be created when explicitly requested -- Robi.

 * Check menu keyboard shortcuts. ALT or CONTROL --- presently ALT-E
   is used twice -- Robi.
 * Group node error feedback should be given while dragging -- Robi.
 * Encapsulated Postscript exporter is broken. It is trying to reimplement
   renderer functionality which, predictably, does not work properly.
   Printing _must_ be done through Renderer and Graphics2D somehow -- Robi.
 * Log display is very slow when large numbers of messages are logged -- Robi.

 * DNFMinimizer fails several test cases -- Robi.

Previously, all bugs were reported and stored in the bug database, http://www.supremica.org/bugtracking, but this is no longer the case.
