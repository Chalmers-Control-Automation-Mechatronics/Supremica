/**
 * <P>A notification sent by a subject to inform its observers that its
 * state has been changed.</P>
 *
 * <P>All objects in the subject implementation support the <EMPH>observer
 * design pattern</EMPH>. Whenever some aspect of a subject is changed,
 * a <CODE>ModelChangeEvent</CODE> is created and passed to the
 * {@link ModelObserver#modelChanged(ModelChangeEvent) modelChanged()}
 * method of all registered observers, as well as all observers registered
 * on some of its parents.</P>
 *
 * <P>The model change event class provides detailed information about the
 * change that is signalled.  The specific type of change signalled is
 * identified by the event <EMPH>kind</EMPH>, which can take the following
 * values.</P>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link #ITEM_ADDED}</LI>
 * <LI>{@link #ITEM_REMOVED}</LI>
 * <LI>{@link #NAME_CHANGED}</LI>
 * <LI>{@link #STATE_CHANGED}</LI>
 * <LI>{@link #GEOMETRY_CHANGED}</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <P>In addition, each event has its <EMPH>source</EMPH> that identifies
 * the item that was affected by the change, and may have an additional
 * <EMPH>value</EMPH> and an index representing the position of a change in
 * a list. The precise meaning of these fields depends on the event
 * kind.</P>
